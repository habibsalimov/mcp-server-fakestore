1. Use fakestore_get_carts to get all carts
2. Calculate total items per cart
3. Identify the user with most items
4. Use fakestore_get_user to get user details
```

### Product Recommendations

```
You: "Based on user 1's cart, recommend similar products"

Claude will:
1. Use fakestore_get_user_carts with userId=1

```

### User Response

```json

      "lat": "-37.3159",
      "long": "81.1496"
    }
  },
  "phone": "1-570-236-7033"
}
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### 1. Use Specific Queries

‚ùå Bad: "Show me products"
‚úÖ Good: "Show me the first 10 electronics products sorted by ID"

### 2. Combine Multiple Tools

Ask Claude to perform multi-step operations:

```
"Find user 1, get their cart, and show details for each product in the cart"
```

### 3. Use Natural Language

Claude understands context:

```
"What's the most expensive product in the electronics category?"
```

### 4. Leverage Caching

The server caches responses for 5 minutes, so repeated queries are faster.

## Limitations

1. **Read-Only**: All POST/PUT/DELETE operations return fake responses
2. **No Authentication**: The API is public and doesn't require API keys
3. **Fixed Data**: Data doesn't change (great for testing, not for real apps)
4. **Rate Limiting**: No rate limits, but please be respectful
